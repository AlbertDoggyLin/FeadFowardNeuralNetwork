# Feed Foward Neural Network prepared for generic algorithm
## introduction
This repo is for feed forward that only provide dense layer of feed forward neural network (not even back propogation)
The activation function contains relu, sigmoid, and elu
## to run the code
1. create virtualenv
2. install package by requirement.txt
3. run test.py or if you want to customize the DNN more, see more detail from createSimpleModel in DNN.__init.py__

- cmd command
